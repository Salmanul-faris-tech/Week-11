a. Monitor Processes with ps and top / htop

ps: Displays running processes and their details (PID, user, CPU, memory).

Example: ps aux

top: Shows real-time process activity and system resource usage.

htop: An enhanced, user-friendly version of top with colors and interactive controls.

b. Kill Processes Using kill with PID

kill is used to stop or terminate a process using its Process ID (PID).

Example:
kill 1234

Signals can be used, such as:

SIGTERM (graceful stop)

SIGKILL (kill -9, force stop)

c. Jobs and bg / fg (Background & Foreground Processes)

jobs: Lists processes running in the background of the current shell.

bg: Resumes a stopped job in the background.

fg: Brings a background job to the foreground.

Example:

command & → run in background

Ctrl + Z → pause a job

bg %1 / fg %1
