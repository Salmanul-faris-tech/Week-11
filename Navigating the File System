a. Practice with commands: ls, cd, pwd, tree

ls: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
Example: ls -l shows detailed information.

cd: Changes the current directory.
Example: cd Documents

pwd: Displays the full path of the current directory.

tree: Shows directories and files in a tree-like structure, making hierarchy easy to understand.

b. Absolute vs Relative Paths

Absolute path: Full path starting from the root (/).
Example: /home/user/Documents/file.txt

Relative path: Path relative to the current directory.
Example: Documents/file.txt

Absolute paths work from anywhere, while relative paths depend on your current location.

c. Simple Mind Map of Directory Navigation
/
├── home
│   └── user
│       ├── Documents
│       ├── Downloads
│       └── Pictures
├── etc
├── var
└── usr


This mind map helps visualize directory structure and understand how folders are connected.
