a. Learn: cp, mv, rm, touch

cp: Copies files or directories.
Example: cp file.txt backup.txt

mv: Moves or renames files and directories.
Example: mv old.txt new.txt

rm: Deletes files or directories.
Example: rm file.txt

touch: Creates an empty file or updates a file’s timestamp.
Example: touch notes.txt

b. Practice with options: -r, -f, -i

-r (recursive): Works on directories and their contents.
Example: rm -r folder/

-f (force): Removes files without confirmation or error messages.
Example: rm -f file.txt

-i (interactive): Asks for confirmation before each action.
Example: rm -i file.txt

c. Test Commands in Different Directories and File Types

Practice managing text files, images, and folders.

Use commands inside home, subdirectories, and nested folders.

This helps understand command behavior, permissions, and file structures.
