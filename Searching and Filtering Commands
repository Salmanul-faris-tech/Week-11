a. Use grep to Search Within Files

grep searches for specific words or patterns inside files.

Commonly used to find logs, errors, or keywords.

Example:
grep "error" logfile.txt

Useful options:
-i (ignore case), -n (show line number), -r (recursive search).

b. Locate Files and Directories

find: Searches files and directories based on name, type, size, or time.
Example: find /home -name file.txt

locate: Quickly finds files using a pre-built database.
Example: locate file.txt

find is real-time and accurate, while locate is faster but depends on database updates.

c. Combine Commands with Pipes (|)

Pipes send the output of one command as input to another.

Allows powerful filtering and searching.

Example:
ls -l | grep ".txt"

Helps narrow results efficiently without creating extra files.
