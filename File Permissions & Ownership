a. Understand chmod for Changing File Permissions

chmod is used to change access permissions of files and directories.

Permissions control who can read (r), write (w), or execute (x) a file.

Example:
chmod +x script.sh → makes a file executable.

b. Symbolic vs Numeric Modes

Symbolic mode

Uses letters to define users and permissions.

u (user/owner), g (group), o (others)

Example:
chmod u+x file.sh → adds execute permission to the owner.

Numeric mode

Uses numbers to set permissions quickly.

4 = read, 2 = write, 1 = execute

Example:
chmod 755 file.sh

Owner: read, write, execute

Group & Others: read, execute

c. Use chown to Change File Ownership

chown changes the owner and group of a file or directory.

Example:
chown user:group file.txt

Often used by administrators to manage file access securely.
